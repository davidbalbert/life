Life
====

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Ruby. It relies on the manipulation of matricies and is inspired by [this implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4) of Life in APL.

It requires Ruby 1.9 or later.

This was written in 2013 by David Albert and is in the public domain.
